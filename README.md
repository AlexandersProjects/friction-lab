# Friction Lab

## How to work with this repo

### Repository split rules
Only split when at least one of these is true:
- people star/fork a specific folder
- you add an extended README just for one artifact (more than just a few lines [see](#minimal-publishing-loop) )
- the artifact grows beyond “tiny”
- you want versioning/releases

Until then: keep everything together.

```quote
Repos are for products.
Folders are for practice.
```

### Minimal publishing loop

1. Add artifact to repo
2. Short README for that artifact (5–10 lines)
3. Commit
4. Optional: one tweet / post

## 5. Turning your answers into a friction inventory (this is gold)

Let’s cleanly extract what you already gave me.

### Friction Category 1 – Direction & Decisions

* unclear requirements
* unclear direction
* decisions not written down
* re-discussing old topics
* “we’ll improve later” without structure

➡ **Artifact candidates:**

* decision log template
* “first 5 decisions checklist”
* decision-ownership rules

---

### Friction Category 2 – Setup & Tooling

* long setup time
* no one-click install
* dev envs out of date
* manual steps everywhere

➡ **Artifact candidates:**

* setup checklist
* Python script to update repos
* “minimum dev setup” README

---

### Friction Category 3 – Structure & Standards

* no clear repo structure
* unclear naming
* missing documentation
* inconsistent conventions

➡ **Artifact candidates:**

* naming conventions doc
* default project structure
* README template

---

### Friction Category 4 – Git & Workflow (very strong signal)

This one is **excellent**:

> *“Why doesn’t Git tell you that you have local branches without remotes and that they are probably weak?”*

This is:

* concrete
* personal pain
* repeated
* scriptable

➡ **Perfect Python CLI candidate**
